# Matching Game Project

Memory game is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

## Important Notes

* Made as a part of Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree (IPND).
* Uses starter code [provided by Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) to assist with HTML, CSS, and shuffle function

## How to run the Application

Open `index.html`  and click in one beautiful squared card to init your Memory Game, or click on the link below to see the live version of the game.

## How To Play

Every two card flipped up, counts one movement. The less movements you make the better your score and hability are.

The game starts automatically upon page load. Click the cards to reveal them. The goal is to reveal
cards two at a time to match the pairs. The game ends when all pairs are revealed.
